    <p>
    Ah, Garfield’s lasagna—a dish so legendary that even the mere mention of it can make a cat purr with anticipation. This is no ordinary lasagna, my friends; this is a layered masterpiece of cheesy, saucy delight that has the power to soothe even the grumpiest feline. To make Garfield’s favorite dish, you’ll need enough lasagna noodles to build a small edible fortress, an unholy amount of ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheese, and a rich, meaty tomato sauce that’s been simmered to perfection (and by perfection, I mean until your entire house smells like an Italian grandmother’s kitchen).

    </p>
    <p>
    Start by cooking the noodles until they’re al dente—no mushy noodles allowed unless you want Garfield to look at you with that disapproving stare. Layer them generously with ricotta cheese, because in Garfield’s world, there’s no such thing as too much cheese. Add a hearty layer of meat sauce, followed by more noodles and more cheese. Rinse and repeat until you’ve built a lasagna skyscraper that would make even the Leaning Tower of Pisa jealous. Top it all off with a blanket of gooey mozzarella and a sprinkle of Parmesan, then bake it until the cheese is bubbling and golden. Serve it piping hot, but don’t expect Garfield to share—he’s been waiting all day for this, and he’s not in the mood for charity!
